C# chat server

## How to use

```git clone``` the repo onto your machine  

From the sturdy-journey folder, execute ```dotnet run```. If you don't have the .NET Core SDK installed on your machine, you'll be given a URL where you can download it. You want .NET Core 2.2.

```bash
$ dotnet run

## Notes
- There are many TODOs remaining:
  - More abstraction
  - Exception handling
  - Displaying to users the command they need to quit
  - Unit tests

## Credits

- I wasn't sure how to do this, so I found [this code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Chat_server#C.23) as a jumping-off point, then started refactoring from there.
